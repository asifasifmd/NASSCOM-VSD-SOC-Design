### Important components of chip in a packge are-
   1. **Pads**: It is used to sent signals inside and outside of the chip and executes the instructions.
   2. **Core**: It is a place where all digital logics are present.
   3. **Die** : It is place that contain the ICs.

### Digital AISC Design

**RTL design**: RTL(Register-Transfer Level) design describes how data moves between registers and how the logical operations are performed on that data.
**EDA tools**: EDA(Electronic Design Automation) tools are essential for the design, simulation, verification, and manufacturing of electronic systems.
**PDK data**: PDK(Process Design Kits) are the collection of files used to model a fabrication process for EDA tools. Process design rules are DRC, LVS and PEX.
